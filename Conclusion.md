# Should Mint Classics consider the closure of one of their storage facilities?
I strongly **oppose the closure** of any warehouses. Upon thorough examination of the Mint Classic database, it's evident that the East warehouse outperforms others, particularly in sales, shipment, and efficiency metrics. Notably, products from the East warehouse command an average sales price of $108.46, surpassing the average prices of products from other warehouses, which are below $100. Moreover, the demand for Classic Cars products, housed in the East inventory, is notably high compared to other lines, except for Vintage Cars. However, the profit margins generated by each warehouse and product line, except for Trains, are nearly identical which is approximately 40%.

This analysis underscores the significant influence of various factors on warehouse performance, with notable contributors being product cost and demand. Product demand is primarily driven by customer behavior, whereas product pricing is controlled by the company. Therefore, it can be inferred that optimizing warehouse performance necessitates a holistic consideration of these factors.

Given these insights, closing any storage facility could potentially disrupt operations and hinder overall performance. Therefore, Mint Classics should maintain its existing storage infrastructure, leveraging the strengths of warehouses to drive continued success and profitability.




**Conclusions: -**
1. There are warehouses with low inventory, especially the West warehouse as it is utilized only 50%.
2. The demand for products remained consistent in 2003 and 2004; however, there was a notable decrease in the number of orders placed in 2005. Surprisingly, this change occurred despite the average price of products remaining relatively constant throughout the specified time frame. Further investigation into this phenomenon is warranted, as it influences the sales performance of the company.
3. The profit margin of all product lines is approximately 40%, except for Trains, which stands at 35.07%. This variance requires further investigation into pricing, as it influences the sales performance of the warehouse.
4. 11 products that experienced high demand but are currently out of stock. Urgent attention is required for products currently out of stock, as their unavailability significantly influences the company's overall sales performance.
5. Several products exhibit a sales-through rate below 50%. It is advisable to replace items with a high inventory but low sales with those boasting a high sales-through rate. 
6. Out of the 122 customers in total, only 98 made purchases. Among these 98 customers, 54 did not place any orders in the year 2005. This issue needs to be addressed as it signifies a loss of customers for the company.
7. Among the 122 customers, 21 have outstanding balances, with 3 of them exceeding their credit limits. This situation poses a potential risk of loss for the company and requires immediate attention.
8. Among the 17 sales representatives, 9 successfully secured deals with clients, but encountered issues that affected their performance. Additionally, two sales representatives with employee numbers 1619 and 1625 did not contribute to any sales. Investigation is needed to determine why the shipments were not delivered to customers if the orders were not cancelled by the customers, and why these two employees did not contribute to sales.
