**Recommendations: -**

* It is advisable to utilize at least 80% of the warehouse capacity by stocking products that are in high demand.
* Despite the average price of products remaining relatively constant throughout the specified time frame, there was a notable decrease in the number of orders placed in 2005 as 54 customers didnâ€™t place any order. The company should focus more on strategies to attract customers.
* Reducing the profit margin to 20%-30% on products with low Sales-through rate could facilitate their clearance and attract more customers, potentially boosting sales.
* Inventory management requires enhancement, as 11 products in high demand were not shipped due to insufficient inventory levels.
* The company should review its credit policy and enhance its credit risk management. Currently, there are 21 customers with outstanding balances, and among them, 3 customers have exceeded their credit limits. Failure to address this issue could result in financial losses for the company.
* The company should also prioritize evaluating employee performance, as it significantly impacts the company's financial performance.
